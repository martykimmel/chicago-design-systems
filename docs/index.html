        <p>
          How does a 130-year-old bank create, support and scale a design
          system?
        </p>
        <p>
          Members of Northern Trust's product design and UI services team will
          provide a look into their multi-year journey to build a design system
          for their client-facing digital experiences. You'll learn about the
          ecosystem of visual and technical resources and tooling they use
          today, as well as how they grew support and use of the system through
          educational resources and more.
        </p>
        <p>The team will cover:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scaling a design system with limited resources</li>
          <li>Design tooling and multi-disciplinary collaboration</li>
          <li>Technical delivery and approach</li>

        <h3>Conversant</h3>
        <p>
          Conversant is a leader in interaction management, empowering brands to
          transform ordinary customer experiences into meaningful, human
          experiences. Their connected suite of personalized digital media
          products and services combines leading-edge identity management, data
          science expertise and privacy by design to create human connections
          that count, everywhere. As part of Epsilon, Conversant employs more
          than 2,100 associates in 17 offices worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learn about the unique ways Conversant built their enterprise design
          system as well as the different approach they’ve taken to establishing
          UX as a practice in their organization. The tools that support
          Conversant’s business both internally and externally are extremely
          diverse and complex. Maintaining a design system flexible enough to
          handle those business needs requires ongoing strategic alignment,
          forward-thinking UX and UI, and smart, efficient code. In this meetup,
          we’ll do a deep dive into what makes Conversant’s design system so
          successful and cover tactical ways to solving enterprise-level
          challenges.

        <h3>Before the Design System… Research!</h3>
        <p>
          Methods, audits and communications that can help shape the design
          system before any documentation or code is written. What do your users
          need, and what will be the most beneficial for your specific use-case?
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll show you what we did at Cars.com to research use of past tools,
          interview prospective users, conduct audits of our patterns and
          competitors, and use that research to create our newly-launched design
          system!
